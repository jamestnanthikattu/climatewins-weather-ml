PowerPoint presentation and machine learning summary for analyzing weather conditions and climate change using ClimateWins.

# ClimateWins Weather Machine Learning Presentation

This repository contains a PowerPoint presentation created by **James Nanthikattu** as part of a project to analyze weather data and understand the impact of climate change using machine learning models.

## 📊 Presentation Overview
The project uses weather data from across Europe to test different machine learning algorithms:
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

The goal is to explore which models can best predict weather patterns and identify signs of climate change.
